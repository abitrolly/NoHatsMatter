We are trying to hack on Open Source Sustainability problem, so these question to the government.

Are there any Doughtnut Economics pilots, Open Source Sustainability or Environmental Sustainability programs going on?
How are they funded, how the New Green Deal (COP26) is supposed to work? 
What are economic metrics and finance distribution algorithms for public infrastructure?
How can we apply these models to supporting people behind Open Source projects?

While trying to solve the problem ourselves, as a community we've already faced with MTB and AML regulations that are
made to protect giants like PayPal by agents named FinCEN, and this big money business it's not our game.
