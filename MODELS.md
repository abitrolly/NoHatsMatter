The Problem: No project is possible without using Open Source. It saves tremendous resources by cutting
development time, and yet people supporting Open Source projects are often on the brink of survival. Sometimes
even beyond in terms of mental health and well-being as normal human beings. This affects the community and
makes a lot of people feel hopeless, sad and miserable. This can be fixed, but previous attempts failed as they
faced with protective mechanisms set by governments and agencies to regulate their business gameplay.

The Goal: Preserve Open Source values, community, and develop models that care about Open Source maintainers and
contributions, so that they can support Open Source projects in sustainable way (without sacrificing their
financial, physical and mental well-being). This will eliminate one of the important causes of degrading security
in the net, and guarantee passing the experience and knowledge.

# Exising economic models of Open Source Software Sustainability.

### Traditional Donation Button

Not sustainable. The amount is too low. Even [well known hackers](https://www.patreon.com/esr) are barely covering
necessary living expenses.

For everybody else this doesn't work. Public team projects are [collecting](https://opencollective.com/element-plus)
as a little as $100/m for the amount of [popularity](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus) they gained.

**Donation Buttons**

* Good Sides
  * Raises awareness
  * Gives a possibility
  * Platforms makes it easy
  * "Works" for any type of project
* Drawbacks
  * Gives an illusion that somebody helps the project
  * Buttons like PayPal lack transparency to understand th
  * Not available for many countries
    * Not clear for which people it doesn't work
  * High processing fees need high minimal amount

Conclusion: **Not Sustainable** if you're not a well known personality.

Why buttons don't work. Insights for validation.

 * People who donate are Open Source developers themselves, and they barely making enough themselves
 * There are many projects and just effort to donate to everybody is significant
 * Processing fees are too high, so $15 can only be used to give $5 to 3 projects, but not $1 to 15

### Consulting for Open Source with Direct Business Value

Maintainers from projects like CMS/CRMs can rely on consulting services for members of community, who
can directly evaluate the business value from the project to compensate people their time.

* Good
  * Natural integration into market gameplay (market economics)
  * Healthy people relationships
* Bad
  * Resources are probably not enough to compensate dependencies of dependencies
  * Doesn't work for libs and small niche projects (leftpad, OpenSSL, log4j)
  * Doesn't work for non-business projects

### Open Source Support by Subscription (Canonical, ex-RedHat)

* Good
  * Supporing community projects by hiring people who are open and transparent (RedHat/Fedora/CentOS)
  * Advocation for shared Open Source values in business world
  * Providing reliable support with long term guarantees for government
* Bad
  * Corporate problems are different from what community can support

### Foundations

* Good
  * Some people can work full time on highly impacted projects in rather independt way
  * Stable source on income (yes?)
  * Legal and paperwork covered
  * Ability to organize and hold events with sponsorship
* Bad
  * Sometimes is it just corporations sharing costs
  * High level of entry to get paid
  * Clear distinction between paid and non paid members
  * Supporting sponsots may have more priority than community support
  * Poor transparency (what does where, who receives what, how much is the capacity, what is needed?)
  * Administrative costs can easily eat up all resources
  * Governmental regulations kick in (can't support person from Belarus etc.)

### Grants and contracts

* Good
  * You can get it if you can write reports and have a university
  * The sums can be big
* Bad
  * You need to be a scientist to get through the bureacracy
  * Most of your time will be filling reports
  * You will need to hire programmers from your own pocket (https://discourse.sustainoss.org/t/folding-home-the-software-that-fights-covid-19-has-one-developer-on-a-payroll/640)

### Crypto platforms

* Good
  * Low entry barrier
  * Transparency
  * Awesome technology
  * People who dream big and extremely supportive community
  * Economic models such as quadratic funding can be enforced by smart contracts
* Bad
  * Concerns about high energy consumption in regions with low cost of fossil energy sources
  * High transaction fees, because of competition with NFT platforms
  * Regulators intervene harsh and don't provide any clarity
    * Foundation managed projects are unable to accept crypto and don't provide clarity too
  * Nobody accepts crypto to pay for living expenses

# Proposed economic models for companies with culture that goes beyond the bottom line

Market Economics from 193x about endless growth on limited resources are poorly designed to support any infrastructure support and maintenance.
Basically its model is to tax other players in a forceful way to distribute the extracted amount into infrastructure projects.

For the limited scope of this hackaton we tried not to dig into alternative Economic model, but provide some hacks that can be used in this
current Economic gameplay. They serve both as the criteria for people who like and support Open Source to choose a company, and also for
companies who want to raise a culture that attract such people.

### Employee Matched Donation Model

The model itself not new. Google and other companies had Open Source donation programs where for each $ that you donate to Open Source
projects from your pocket, they placed addional matching value. If you donate $5 they donate $5 etc. There are restrictions on to which
companies you can donate. Probably not to individual Open Source projects.

The hack we propose is to pay matched donation for employee before taxes. This way the donation that the person does, because the Open
Source helps him with his job, will be doubled automatically, and it won't be only an option for big tech. The legal and technological
base still need to be developed to make it accessible to any type of business.

### Dedicate one salary to Open Source dependencies

By using Open Source you've already saved months of development (investors money) for your team. Advocating and making your investors
aware, you allow them to make informed decisions, that let them attract top talents from Open Source communities, who care about giving
back to their projects and support those who take over the maintenance for that time. That also gives you startup/company a chance to
become a good friends with developers (Blender's mafia model), if one day you will need to fine tune your Linux to hold 190,541 players
on one server (Wargaming).

If one startup is pizze team of five, then 1/5 is the fair estimation of the value that Open Source already provided for you development
team. Spreading this 5th share amoung dependencies of your projects is the right way to build healty ecosystem.

### Weighted donation distribution graph

Platforms like https://en.liberapay.com allow to distribute as little as $0.01 to different projects. Liberapay is a fork from Gratipay.
Gratipay was a project that originated in US, but was shut down, because US law system protects PayPal at the cost of everybody else.
Accused of being Money Transfer Business (MTB) with no license which costs about $500k for each state yearly, Gratipay had no choice
other than to cease and desist. Read Gratipocalypse from the head of this doc. Liberapay is based in EU.

On registration Gratipay gave each new user $1. The sum is too low to be serious, but high enough to give a person ability to set $0.01
weekly donations to liked projects and people. No strings attached. The donations were open, transparent on the web site. When a person
or project received donation, they could also decide to give it to somebody else. This gave us **the live graph of donation distribution**.
There were sitations were people in Open Source community were experiencing life difficulties, being left without a job, with a heart
stroke, with no corporate who could allocate money to aid them, and we've seen how the graph just in one week dynamically reallocated
the stream to help those people.

If we normalize weekly donation budget of each person to be 1.00 (or 100%) regardless of absolute value, then each donation from this
person, like 0.01, will be a weight of distribution in the graph. On other words how important this specific project to this person in
comparison to other projects, in %. Given the list of projects, an organization, fund, or another person can give money in absolute
value to be distributed exactly the same.

This allows maintainers to help their dependencies and projects that inspire them, indirectly through their expertise and trust,
boosting the flow of resources in the directions that they see as right.

This is just one of the usage scenarios for the graph. Visualization and tools will help to explore it for many other things, such as
capacity building and "capacity overflow growth" that could be useful to onboard people for experiments with different Economic models.

### Open Source Policy and Smart NDA Policy

When people are hired, the company usually (always?) forces to them to sign NDA, and even non-compete agreements, so the person
effectively loses ability to contribute to projects. Even if those contributions reduce pile up of technical debt and costs of merging.

This happens, because laywers are ignorant, illerate, not being aware enough or persuasive enough to understand the difference between
**core business value** of their startups. The value that is separates from the cost of development, maintenance and support of software
that powers it. If you are a book shop, you core value is selling books, you approach to readers, unique design, engagement strategy.
Fixing a broken payment module don't have to be under NDA. It is not why you competitors are better than you. If your book shop shares
the fix with upstream, somebody else will spend this time of fixing another bug that will not appear in your project. It is not a zero
sum game. Unless there is an NDA that effectively prevents you from committing anything anywhere without permission of your company.

If you, as a lawyer, could replace catch-all NDA policy with clean text that covers only the company repos and secrets that makes
common sense, you will hace a great chance to attract not only people skilled in software development, but also those who care about
what you do for real.

If Smart NDA is restrictive document. **The Open Source Policy** is the opposite. It is an indicator of your culture - how do you
treat the ecosystem gameplay and involvement. What are the rules that people from the Open Source community can read to feel themselve
comfortable. If you want to showcase some of the economic models and experiments above, put them here.

Clean NDA policy allows developer to contribute to upstream projects, but not share commercial secrets. Good Open Source Policy
provides support funds for dependencies, and allows dedicated paid time to contributeupstread and integrate own patches back.

### Humans As Artifacts

Hire Open Source developers. But not as resources. Mentors, advisers, people to help estblish best practices in Open Source world
and integrate with their products. Open Source people who are not completely detached from their community are more valuable for the
ecosystem and future growth than they being ordinary coders. Sometimes you want to hang out with interesting people to exchanges
experience, and it works in both ways. It enriches ecosystem. Makes the community aware of the problems of business, and business to
become more about people. Preserving Open Source independecy is a great value. It can raise transparency of the processes, remove
overly protective barriers that waste people time. It is an interesting challenge and experiment, and I leave out any hardcoded
advice here, because maybe you already have something to share on this journey.
