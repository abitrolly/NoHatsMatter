The Problem: No project is possible without using Open Source. It saves tremendous resources by cutting
development time, and yet people supporting Open Source projects are often on the brink of survival. Sometimes
even beyond in terms of mental health and well-being as normal human beings. This affects the community and
makes a lot of people feel hopeless, sad and miserable. This can be fixed, but previous attempts failed as they
faced with protective mechanisms set by governments and agencies to regulate their business gameplay.

The Goal: Preserve Open Source values, community, and develop models that care about Open Source maintainers and
contributions, so that they can support Open Source projects in sustainable way (without sacrificing their
financial, physical and mental well-being). This will eliminate one of the important causes of degrading security
in the net, and guarantee passing the experience and knowledge.

# Exising economic models of Open Source Software Sustainability.

### Traditional Donation Button

Not sustainable. The amount is too low. Even [well known hackers](https://www.patreon.com/esr) are barely covering
necessary living expenses.

For everybody else this doesn't work. Public team projects are [collecting](https://opencollective.com/element-plus)
as a little as $100/m for the amount of [popularity](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus) they gained.

**Donation Buttons**

* Good Sides
  * Raises awareness
  * Gives a possibility
  * Platforms makes it easy
  * "Works" for any type of project
* Drawbacks
  * Gives an illusion that somebody helps the project
  * Buttons like PayPal lack transparency to understand th
  * Not available for many countries
    * Not clear for which people it doesn't work
  * High processing fees need high minimal amount

Conclusion: **Not Sustainable** if you're not a well known personality.

Why buttons don't work. Insights for validation.

 * People who donate are Open Source developers themselves, and they barely making enough themselves
 * There are many projects and just effort to donate to everybody is significant
 * Processing fees are too high, so $15 can only be used to give $5 to 3 projects, but not $1 to 15

### Consulting for Open Source with Direct Business Value

Maintainers from projects like CMS/CRMs can rely on consulting services for members of community, who
can directly evaluate the business value from the project to compensate people their time.

* Good
  * Natural integration into market gameplay (market economics)
  * Healthy people relationships
* Bad
  * Resources are probably not enough to compensate dependencies of dependencies
  * Doesn't work for libs and small niche projects (leftpad, OpenSSL, log4j)
  * Doesn't work for non-business projects

### Open Source Support by Subscription (Canonical, ex-RedHat)

* Good
  * Supporing community projects by hiring people who are open and transparent (RedHat/Fedora/CentOS)
  * Advocation for shared Open Source values in business world
  * Providing reliable support with long term guarantees for government
* Bad
  * Corporate problems are different from what community can support

### Foundations

* Good
  * Some people can work full time on highly impacted projects in rather independt way
  * Stable source on income (yes?)
  * Legal and paperwork covered
  * Ability to organize and hold events with sponsorship
* Bad
  * Sometimes is it just corporations sharing costs
  * High level of entry to get paid
  * Clear distinction between paid and non paid members
  * Supporting sponsots may have more priority than community support
  * Poor transparency (what does where, who receives what, how much is the capacity, what is needed?)
  * Administrative costs can easily eat up all resources
  * Governmental regulations kick in (can't support person from Belarus etc.)

### Grants and contracts

* Good
  * You can get it if you can write reports and have a university
  * The sums can be big
* Bad
  * You need to be a scientist to get through the bureacracy
  * Most of your time will be filling reports
  * You will need to hire programmers from your own pocket (https://discourse.sustainoss.org/t/folding-home-the-software-that-fights-covid-19-has-one-developer-on-a-payroll/640)

### Crypto platforms

* Good
  * Low entry barrier
  * Transparency
  * Awesome technology
  * People who dream big and extremely supportive community
  * Economic models such as quadratic funding can be enforced by smart contracts
* Bad
  * Concerns about high energy consumption in regions with low cost of fossil energy sources
  * High transaction fees, because of competition with NFT platforms
  * Regulators intervene harsh and don't provide any clarity
    * Foundation managed projects are unable to accept crypto and don't provide clarity too
  * Nobody accepts crypto to pay for living expenses

# Proposed economic models for companies with culture that goes beyond the bottom line

Market Economics from 193x about endless growth on limited resources are poorly designed to support any infrastructure support and maintenance.
Basically its model is to tax other players in a forceful way to distribute the extracted amount into infrastructure projects.

For the limited scope of this hackaton we tried not to dig into alternative Economic model, but provide some hacks that can be used in this
current Economic gameplay. They serve both as the criteria for people who like and support Open Source to choose a company, and also for
companies who want to raise a culture that attract such people.

### Employee Matched Donation Model

The model itself not new. Google and other companies had Open Source donation programs where for each $ that you donate to Open Source
projects from your pocket, they placed addional matching value.

you wark for a company and if you donate money to opensource you employer doubles anount of money employee donated
                YouDonate X, Google donates 2*X
                pros: company does not lose money if they do that before paying taxes

            X*egineers donations:
                company calcualtes average salary of developer and spreds the sallary of this developer amoung it dependent projects
                1/5 for startup --- ???

            Open Weighted donation distribution graph
                like https://en.liberapay.com

            OpenSourcePolicy --- Anti NDA OpenSoruce policy
                When somebody coms to new company he signs NDA -> effectivly lose ability to contribute to projects

                Clean NDA policy that allows developer to contribute
                Company allows developers to spend X amount of hours to opensource project and be payed

            Humans As Artefacts
                Hire opensource developers
                It is public process of hiring opensource developer to 100\% opensource developer managment free
                As a benefit people in company get company and inspiration just like opensource developer
