Economic models of Open Source Software Sustainability.

### Traditional Donation Button

Not sustainable. The amount is too low. Even [well known hackers](https://www.patreon.com/esr) are barely covering
necessary living expenses.

For everybody else this doesn't work. Public team projects are [collecting](https://opencollective.com/element-plus)
as a little as $100/m for the amount of [popularity](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus) they gained.

**Donation Buttons**

* Good Sides
  * Raises awareness
  * Gives a possibility
  * Platforms makes it easy
  * "Works" for any type of project
* Drawbacks
  * Gives an illusion that somebody helps the project
  * Buttons like PayPal lack transparency to understand th
  * Not available for many countries
    * Not clear for which people it doesn't work
  * High processing fees need high minimal amount

Conclusion: **Not Sustainable** if you're now a well known personality.

Why buttons don't work. Insights for validation.

 * People who donate are Open Source developers themselves, and they barely making enough themselves
 * There are many projects and just effort to donate to everybody is significant
 * Processing fees are too high, so $15 can only be used to give $5 to 3 projects, but not $1 to 15

### Employee Matched Donation Model

                you wark for a company and if you donate money to opensource you employer doubles anount of money employee donated
                YouDonate X, Google donates 2*X
                pros: company does not lose money if they do that before paying taxes

            X*egineers donations:
                company calcualtes average salary of developer and spreds the sallary of this developer amoung it dependent projects
                1/5 for startup --- ???

            Open Weighted donation distribution graph
                like https://en.liberapay.com

            OpenSourcePolicy --- Anti NDA OpenSoruce policy
                When somebody coms to new company he signs NDA -> effectivly lose ability to contribute to projects

                Clean NDA policy that allows developer to contribute
                Company allows developers to spend X amount of hours to opensource project and be payed

            Humans As Artefacts
                Hire opensource developers
                It is public process of hiring opensource developer to 100\% opensource developer managment free
                As a benefit people in company get company and inspiration just like opensource developer
